Our goal was to create a product that's not only precise but also affordable for ordinary customers. Achieving this, our collar utilizes patented AI-powered software, combining GPS with the recognition of the dog's indoor or outdoor environment. This innovation not only ensures accuracy but also eliminates the need for monthly cellular payments, making it a cost-friendly choice for pet owners. Unlike low-tier models that rely solely on GPS and can be unreliable due to obstacles, our solution minimizes false triggers, providing a more reliable tracking experience.",

Even in the static correction mode, the system initiates with sound and vibration, allowing the dog to return before any static correction occurs. Dogs typically learn to respond to the warning sound and return promptly. It's important to note that the static correction is gentle, akin to a tap, designed to draw the dog's attention without causing harm.",
